# Windows Penetration Testing Toolkit
A collection of tools I wrote while studying for eCPTX!

## Getting Started
This tool has some dependencies that may need to be installed. It was written and tested on Kali Linux 2021.4 so most of the dependencies are already pre-installed. In the event you are using an older version or non-Kali install, you can get started by running the following commands:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```bash
sudo apt-get install xfce4-terminal
```
```bash
sudo apt-get install powershell-empire
```
```bash
sudo apt-get install starkiller
```

## winpwn.py
A collection of tools that I find myself using on a regular basis. This puts them all in one place and speeds up the use process. 
```bash
sudo python3 winpwn.py
```

## empire-launcher.py
A simple script that loads PowerShell Empire Server and then launches the Starkiller GUI.
```bash
sudo python3 empire-launcher.py
```
