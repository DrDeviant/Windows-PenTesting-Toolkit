# Windows Penetration Testing Toolkit
A collection of tools I wrote while studying for eCPTX!

## Getting Started
This tool has some dependencies that may need to be installed. You can get started by running the following commands:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```bash
sudo apt-get install xfce4-terminal
```
## empire-launcher.py
A simple script that loads PowerShell Empire Server and then launches the Starkiller GUI
